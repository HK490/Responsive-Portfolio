      <p class="para">My name is Helen Kim.  I was born in South Korea and I came to the states when I was 7 years old.  I lived in north georgia until I graduated high school.  I played the flute in the band in Georgia at my school and the violin in the orchestra at a neighboring school in Tennessee. I enjoy playing the piano for fun, listening to music, and watching movies.  I also like playing video games such as resident evil series and mobile battleground.  I love dogs and I like being around dogs more than I like being around people.  My favorite color is yellow and I'm a big time introvert.  I have a dog name Ruby and a husband.  My husband also works in IT, but primarily in the back-end.<br><br>I graduated from UGA with a major in Health Promotion and Behaviors. Then I worked for about 2 years and went back to school for a certification course at Duke for 1 year.  Then I worked for another 2 years and now I'm back in school for another certification but in a completely different field.  I am excited.  So far it's hard, but I like the outcomes created by coding.  However, I wish to be done with school after this course for a very long time or forever.</p>
